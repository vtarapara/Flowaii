# Flowaii

See the [pages site](https://ath11.pages.oit.duke.edu/flowaii/) for more info about this project.

## Main

This branch is for:
- the software for training ML pFlow implementations (flowaii) as well as ML pFlow /emulators/ (flowaie).
- the tools for comparing and evaluating flowaii and flowaie performance
- the formal project documentation

### Contributing

We are a small team, so we could work from feature branches.
However, it may be best to work from forks following the workflow [here](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/gittutorial/)
- Get your own copy (fork the repository)
- Develop on a /feature branch/ of your fork
- Commit your code and push it back to *your* gitlab repository

## Pages Branch

This branch is for project documentation.
